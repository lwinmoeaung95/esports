		<h2>About</h2>
		<p class="cspabout">
			The Counter-Strike series is a popular team-based first-person shooter video game series originating as a modification of Valve's first-person shooter Half-Life. The gameplay consists of a team of Counter-Terrorists against a team of Terrorists in rounds of competition won either by completing an objective or completely eliminating the opposing team.

			They have been the most widely played online first-person shooters for the past several years. As of August 2011, the series has sold over 25 million units since the original release of Counter-Strike.

		<h2>Game Play</h2>
		<p class="cspgp">
			Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to repeatedly complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or capturing hostages.
			At the end of each short round, players are rewarded based on individual and team performance with in-game currency to spend on other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds.
			Winning rounds generally rewards more money than losing does, and completing map-based objectives, including killing enemies, gives additional cash bonuses.
