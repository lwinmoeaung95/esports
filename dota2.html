		<h2>The Map</h2>
		<p class="pmap">
			The Map is the playing field for all Dota 2 matches. It is comprised of two sides, one for the Radiant icon.png Radiant faction, and one for the Dire . To win, players must destroy the opposing side's Ancient, an important building at the center of each team's base. The map is represented in the interface by the minimap.
		</p>
	</div>	
	<div class="lane">
		<h2>The Lane</h2>
		<p class="plane">
			The map is segmented into three different lanes, the top, the bottom, and the middle lane. Each one of these lanes leads to the other team's base, guarded by towers along the way. During the early laning phase of the game, most gameplay is centered around the lanes.

			The bottom lane for the Radiant icon.png Radiant, and the top lane for the Dire , are considered safe lanes. Creeps meet each other close to the towers, which provide greater protection from enemies. These lanes are recommended for beginners, as they provide some added protection against ganking.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="river">
		<h2>The River</h2>
		<p class="priver">
			The River separates the two factional sides of the map. It is surrounded by high ground, which blocks players' vision on both sides.

	<div class="runes">
		<h2>Runes</h2>
		<p class="prunes">
			There are two types of Runes that spawn at different locations on the map: Power-up Runes and Bounty Runes. Power-up Runes spawn in 2 minute intervals while Bounty Runes spawn in 3 minute intervals. As their names imply, Power-up Runes grant players bonuses and Bounty Runes a bounty.
			From the start of the game onward, Bounty Runes will spawn at four different locations on the map, two of which on the River, and the other two on the Radiant and Dire side each.
